I&#39;m passionate about building web applications, exploring computer security, and mastering new application development frameworks. My skills include Python, C++, Javascript, Vue.js, Django, and much more! In my free time when I&#39;m not coding, I enjoy going to the gym, hiking, body boarding, cooking and gaming. I&#39;m excited about the limitless possibilities of web development and eager to expand my knowledge further in this ever changing field.</p><h2 id="education" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#education"><span>Education</span></a></h2><ul><li><strong>B.S.
