The title sequence for Stranger Things is also one of my favorites for any show I&#39;ve watched.

My favorite season is season 3 which is when my favorite characters, Steve, shows most of his growth as a character.</p><h2 id="technical-details" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#technical-details"><span>Technical Details</span></a></h2><p>To create this animation I followed an excellent write up <a href="https://www.roboleary.net/animation/2023/05/30/how-to-make-a-slick-animation-stranger-things-title-sequence.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found here</a>.
