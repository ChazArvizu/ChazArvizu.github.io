We used the technologies Flutter and Firebase which helped to tremendously streamline our development process in creating a multi-platform application.</p><h2 id="development-process" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#development-process"><span>Development Process</span></a></h2><h3 id="first-semester-waterfall-approach" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#first-semester-waterfall-approach"><span>First Semester: Waterfall Approach</span></a></h3><p>The first semester we took a waterfall approach to development by creating all the necessary documentation before we began implementation. <strong>Created Documentation</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Class Diagram:</strong> Defined the structure and relationships of the classes within the application, helping us understand how different parts of the system interact.</li><li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Detailed the interactions between users and the system, ensuring all user requirements were captured.</li><li><strong>System Requirement Specification:</strong> Outlined the functional and non-functional requirements, providing a clear scope for development.</li><li><strong>Sequence Diagrams:</strong> Illustrated how objects interact in a particular sequence, clarifying the flow of operations for each feature.</li><li><strong>UML diagram:</strong> Offered a visual representation of the system&#39;s architecture, aiding in better planning and communication among team members.</li></ul><p>All of these different documents helped to improve our development process in the second semester by ensuring the team had a good idea of how each feature should be implemented.</p><h3 id="second-semester-agile-approach-scrum-framework" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#second-semester-agile-approach-scrum-framework"><span>Second Semester: Agile Approach (SCRUM Framework)</span></a></h3><p>In the second semester we took an agile approach to development and utilized SCRUM as our development framework.</p><ul><li>Created a backlog of which consisted of user stories, and bugs encountered during development.</li><li>Planned sprints and held daily stand ups, where the professor acted as SCRUM Master.</li><li>Conducted a sprint reviews and sprint planning sessions.</li></ul><p>This structured development process enabled us to complete the application efficiently and in an organized manner.</p><h2 id="technologies" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#technologies"><span>Technologies</span></a></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Frontend</strong>: Flutter</p><ul><li>We used flutter for our frontend development because it provided a way for us to only have to code something once and have code that can be compiled to both Android and IOS applications. We used a tool called FlutterFlow which also helped to speed up our development process.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Backend</strong>: Firebase</p><ul><li>Firebase is a Backend as a service that provided us many &quot;out of the box&quot; services to implement in our app. The services that we used were the realtime database, authentication and cloud storage. Firebase also seamlessly integrates with Flutter because they are both developed/maintained by Google. FlutterFlow made it easy to configure Firebase in our application via a service account which made all the automated changes to the Firebase based on the configurations we input.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="services" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#services"><span>Services</span></a></h2><ul><li><strong>Jira</strong>: Project management software that helped us plan sprints and assign tasks.</li><li><strong>Github</strong>: Version control system.</li></ul><h2 id="features" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#features"><span>Features</span></a></h2><ul><li>User authentication and authorization</li><li>Meal creation and management</li><li>Meal tracking</li><li>Workout routine creation and management</li><li>Workout tracking</li><li>Goal creation and management</li></ul>',21),i=[n];function o(l,c){return t(),a("div",null,i)}const p=e(r,[["render",o],["__file","gymrat.html.vue"]]),h=JSON.parse('{"path":"/projects/gymrat.html","title":"Gym Rat (Senior Design Class)","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Production Date","slug":"production-date","link":"#production-date","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Description","slug":"description","link":"#description","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Development Process","slug":"development-process","link":"#development-process","children":[{"level":3,"title":"First Semester: Waterfall Approach","slug":"first-semester-waterfall-approach","link":"#first-semester-waterfall-approach","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Second Semester: Agile Approach (SCRUM Framework)","slug":"second-semester-agile-approach-scrum-framework","link":"#second-semester-agile-approach-scrum-framework","children":[]}]},{"level":2,"title":"Technologies","slug":"technologies","link":"#technologies","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Services","slug":"services","link":"#services","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Features","slug":"features","link":"#features","children":[]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1716347983000,"contributors":[{"name":"ChazArvizu","email":"cryan018@gmail.com","commits":4}]},"filePathRelative":"projects/gymrat.md"}');export{p as comp,h as data};
