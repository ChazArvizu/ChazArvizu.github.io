LiftJourn provides the user with an easy to use and convenient way to keep track of their workouts to see their progress over time. LiftJourn will have both a free and paid version available to users. The paid version will allow more functionality and statical analysis. I have designed and developed this application all as a solo developer, leaning both Django and Vue.js as I develop the application.</p><h2 id="technologies" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#technologies"><span>Technologies</span></a></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Frontend</strong>: Vue.js</p><ul><li>Vue.js is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. I chose Vue.js for LiftJourn due to its popularity, ease of learning, and the vibrant community backing it. Additionally, Vue.js offers excellent documentation and tooling, making it a great choice for rapid development. My Vue.js frontend consumes the Django backend API, which serves as the backend infrastructure for LiftJourn.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Backend</strong>: Django</p><ul><li>Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Django also offers great documentation along with many online resources for learning the framework. I use the django REST framework as my backend API which is consumed by my Vue.js frontend.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Database</strong>: PostgreSQL</p><ul><li>PostgreSQL is the best supported backend for Django. It offers a wide range of advanced features, including support for complex queries, indexing, full-text search, and JSON data types.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Deployment</strong>: Digital Ocean</p><ul><li>DigitalOcean offers competitive pricing, with a straightforward pricing model that includes transparent pricing for all services. It also provides simple documentation, making it easy for developers to set up and manage servers, databases, and other cloud infrastructure components. I wa originally going to use AWS, but the Digital Ocean pricing scheme seemed more straight forward and forgiving</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="services" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#services"><span>Services</span></a></h2><ul><li><strong>Github</strong>: Version control system.
