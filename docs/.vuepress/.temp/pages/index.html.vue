<p>Hello my name is Chaz, I am a recent computer science graduate hailing from Southern California. I'm passionate about building web applications, exploring computer security, and mastering new application development frameworks. My skills include Python, C++, Javascript, Vue.js, Django, and much more! In my free time when I'm not coding, I enjoy going to the gym, hiking, body boarding, cooking and gaming. I'm excited about the limitless possibilities of web development and eager to expand my knowledge further in this ever changing field.</p>
