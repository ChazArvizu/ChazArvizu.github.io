We used the technologies Flutter and Firebase which helped to tremendously streamline our development process.</p><h2 id="development-process" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#development-process"><span>Development Process</span></a></h2><p>The first semester we took a waterfall approach to development by creating all the necessary documentation before we began implementation. We created a Class Diagram, Use Cases, System Requirement Specification, Sequence Diagrams and a UML diagram. All of these documents helped to improve our development process in the second semester by ensuring the team had a good idea of how each feature should be implemented. In the second semester we took an agile approach to development and utilized SCRUM as our development framework. We created a backlog of which consisted of user stories, and bugs; we created sprints and held daily stand ups, where the professor acted as SCRUM Master; at the end of each sprint we had a sprint review; and before each sprint we would have a sprint planning day. By utilizing this development process we were able to successfully complete the application in an organized manner.</p><h2 id="technologies" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#technologies"><span>Technologies</span></a></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Frontend</strong>: Flutter</p><ul><li>We used flutter for our frontend development because it provided a way for us to only have to code something once and have code that can be compiled to both Android and IOS applications. We used a tool called FlutterFlow which also helped to speed up our development process.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Backend</strong>: Firebase</p><ul><li>Firebase is a Backend as a service that provided us many &quot;out of the box&quot; services to implement in our app. The services that we used were the realtime database, authentication and cloud storage. Firebase also seamlessly integrates with Flutter because they are both developed/maintained by Google. FlutterFlow made it easy to configure Firebase in our application via a service account which made all the automated changes to the Firebase based on the configurations we input.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="services" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#services"><span>Services</span></a></h2><ul><li><strong>Jira</strong>: Project management software that helped us plan sprints and assign tasks.</li><li><strong>Github</strong>: Version control system</li></ul><h2 id="features" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#features"><span>Features</span></a></h2><ul><li>User authentication and authorization</li><li>Meal creation and management</li><li>Meal tracking</li><li>Workout routine creation and management</li><li>Workout tracking</li><li>Goal creation and management</li></ul>',11),i=[n];function r(l,c){return a(),t("div",null,i)}const h=e(o,[["render",r],["__file","gymrat.html.vue"]]),p=JSON.parse('{"path":"/projects/gymrat.html","title":"Gym Rat","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Description","slug":"description","link":"#description","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Development Process","slug":"development-process","link":"#development-process","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Technologies","slug":"technologies","link":"#technologies","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Services","slug":"services","link":"#services","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Features","slug":"features","link":"#features","children":[]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1715055050000,"contributors":[{"name":"ChazArvizu","email":"cryan018@gmail.com","commits":3}]},"filePathRelative":"projects/gymrat.md"}');export{h as comp,p as data};
