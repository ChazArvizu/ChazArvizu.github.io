LiftJourn provides the user with an easy to use and convenient way to keep track of their workouts to see their progress over time. LiftJourn will have both a free version and a premium version available to users. The premium version will allow more functionality and statical analysis. I have designed and developed this application all as a solo developer, leaning both Django and Vue.js as I develop the application.</p><h2 id="technologies" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#technologies"><span>Technologies</span></a></h2><h3 id="frontend-vue-js" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#frontend-vue-js"><span>Frontend: Vue.js</span></a></h3><p>Vue.js is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
