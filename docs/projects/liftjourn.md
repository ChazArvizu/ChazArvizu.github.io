## Website
[liftjourn.com](http://www.liftjourn.com/) (This link will take you to a default website where I purchased the domain)

## Description
LiftJourn is a web application that allows users to create workout routines, track their workouts, and interact with friends. LiftJourn provides the user with a easy to use and convenient way to keep track of their workouts and see their progress. It will have both a free and paid version of the application. I have designed and developed this application all as a solo developer.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: Vue.js
  - Vue.js is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable, meaning that you can use as much or as little of Vue.js as you need in your projects.

- **Backend**: Django
  - Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. I use django as my backend API which is consumed by my Vue.js frontend. 

- **Database**: PostgreSQL
  - PostgreSQL is the best supported backend for Django. It offers a wide range of advanced features, including support for complex queries, indexing, full-text search, and JSON data types.

- **Deployment**: Digital Ocean
  - DigitalOcean offers competitive pricing, with a straightforward pricing model that includes transparent pricing for all services. It also provides simple documentation, making it easy for developers to set up and manage servers, databases, and other cloud infrastructure components.

## Services
- **Github**: Version control system
- **Email Validation**: Utilizes a Google Workspace service account to impersonate a noreply email for email validation.
- **Namecheap**: Namecheap offers domain registration, hosting, and other services at a fair price.

## Features
- User authentication and authorization
- Workout routine creation and management
- Workout tracking and progress visualization
- Social features for interacting with friends (coming soon)

## Future Plans
- Implement a mobile version for IOS and Android with Flutter Framework
