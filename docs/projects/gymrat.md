Gym Rat
======

## Description
Gym Rat is a multi platform application that allows users to track both their meals and workouts in one convenient app. This application was developed with a team of five developers, counting me, in a span of two semesters. We used the technologies Flutter and Firebase which helped to tremendously streamline our development process.

## Development Process
The first semester we took a waterfall approach to development by creating all the necessary documentation before we began implementation. We created a Class Diagram, Use Cases, System Requirement Specification, Sequence Diagrams and a UML diagram. All of these documents helped to improve our development process in the second semester by ensuring the team had a good idea of how each feature should be implemented. In the second semester we took an agile approach to development and utilized SCRUM as our development framework. We created a backlog of which consisted of user stories, and bugs; we created sprints and held daily stand ups, where the professor acted as SCRUM Master; at the end of each sprint we had a sprint review; and before each sprint we would have a sprint planning day. By utilizing this development process we were able to successfully complete the application in an organized manner.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: Flutter
    - We used flutter for our frontend development because it provided a way for us to only have to code something once and have code that can be compiled to both Android and IOS applications. We used a tool called FlutterFlow which also helped to speed up our development process. 

- **Backend**: Firebase
    - Firebase is a Backend as a service that provided us many "out of the box" services to implement in our app. The services that we used were the realtime database, authentication and cloud storage. Firebase also seamlessly integrates with Flutter because they are both developed/maintained by Google. FlutterFlow made it easy to configure Firebase in our application via a service account which made all the automated changes to the Firebase based on the configurations we input.

## Services
- **Jira**: Project management software that helped us plan sprints and assign tasks.
- **Github**: Version control system
