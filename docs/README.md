## About Me
Hello my name is Chaz, I am a recent computer science graduate hailing from Southern California. I'm passionate about building web applications, exploring computer security, and mastering new application development frameworks. My skills include Python, C++, Javascript, Vue.js, Django, and much more! In my free time when I'm not coding, I enjoy going to the gym, hiking, body boarding, cooking and gaming. I'm excited about the limitless possibilities of web development and eager to expand my knowledge further in this ever changing field.

- **Acknowledgments**:
    - Fall 2021: President's List
    - Spring 2022: Deans' List
    - Fall 2022: Initiated into Tau Beta Pi - Engineering Honor Society

## Featured Projects
<span style="font-size: 0.9em;">(Click on the project names for more details)</span>

- **[LiftJourn](./projects/liftjourn.md)**: LiftJourn is a web application that allows users to create workout routines, track their workouts, and view their friend's completed workouts. LiftJourn provides the user with an easy to use and convenient way to keep track of their workouts to see their progress over time. LiftJourn will have both a free version and a premium version available to users. The premium version will allow more functionality and statical analysis. I have designed and developed this application all as a solo developer, leaning both Django and Vue.js as I develop the application.

- **[Gym Rat](./projects/gymrat.md)**: Gym Rat is a multi platform application that allows users to track both their meals and workouts in one convenient app. This application was developed with a team of five developers, including myself, in the time span of two semesters. We used the technologies Flutter and Firebase which helped to tremendously streamline our development process in creating a multi-platform application.

## Live Browser Animations

- **[Lorenz Attractor](./lorenz.md)**: I took inspiration to create this little animation from a youtuber by the name of Veritasium, as seen in his video about [chaos theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDek6cYijxI). This video sparked my curiosity about chaos theory and how small changes to the inputs of an equation can drastically change the output of a system. This sort of behavior is present in our everyday life and takes the shape of whatever decisions we make, whether they are big or small. Our decisions are what define us, and chaotic equations offer a special way of mapping such behavior.

- **[Solar System Simulation](./solarsystem.md)**: I have always been fascinated with outer space and its limitless wonders. To capture some of this fascination, I decided to create an interactive solar system simulation. I followed an excellent tutorial, which can be [found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgFnZyL8zEA&t=0). The tutorial provided the necessary JavaScript for the simulation, but additional steps were required to integrate it into VuePress 2.
